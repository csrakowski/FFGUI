FFGUI
=====


Windows GUI application for easy FFMPEG usage.
In it's current stage it only offers the very basic of basics!
I created this tool for own use, and so only included the feature I use myself.
In the future, if I have time, I might add more features.
If you have certain features you would like to see added, let me know.
If you want to build upon this project and created a more advanced and/or prettier GUI, be my guest and make a fork. I'd love to see the result.
